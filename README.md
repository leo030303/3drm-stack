# 3DRM Web App
The web interface for 3DRM.

Includes an sql database, the backend server and the react frontend, with a dockerfile to containerise it for testing/deployment.
Project was never finished due to difficulties described in the 3DRM plugin repo, but had many finished and partially finished features, including a market place for files, the ability to create an ad on the marketplace, login through google, and ability to manage your bought files. Was good practise in web dev.
